Hi YMCA Cedar Glen team,

I'm looking into summer camp options for my two children and was very impressed by what Cedar Glen offers. I'd like to ask about the following programs:

1. **Adventure Camp** for my son Alex, who is 7 years old (entering Grade 3 in September). He's especially interested in swimming and outdoor activities.

2. **Explorer Camp** for my daughter Maya, who is 5 years old (entering Grade 1 in September). She loves nature and art.

We're interested in the weeks of July 7-11 and July 21 through August 15 (4 weeks). A few questions:

- Are those weeks still available for both programs?
- We'd need both before-care (starting 7:30am) and after-care (until 6pm). Can you confirm availability?
- Do you offer a sibling discount for enrolling both children?
- Alex has a mild tree nut allergy. I saw that Cedar Glen is a nut-free facility - could you tell me more about your allergy protocols?

We're planning to attend the February 8 open house as well.

Thank you so much for your time. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Sarah Chen

**Notes:**
- Confirm with partner about the Feb 8 open house date
- If response confirms availability, follow up with registration email
- Will need to provide allergy action plan from doctor at registration
