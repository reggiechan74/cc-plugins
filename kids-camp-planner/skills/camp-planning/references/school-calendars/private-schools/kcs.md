## Planning Notes for KCS Families

### Key Differences from TDSB
- **No PA days**: KCS uses midterm breaks instead. No single-day PA day coverage needed, but the midterm breaks create multi-day gaps that won't align with any PA day programs.
- **2-week March break**: Mar 9-20 vs TDSB Mar 16-20. Week 1 (Mar 9-13) has NO March break programs running (public schools in session). Week 2 (Mar 16-20) aligns with TDSB.
- **2 midterm breaks**: November (2 days) and February (2 days) have no public board equivalent. No dedicated programs will be running.
- **Earlier summer start**: School ends June 11 vs TDSB June 25. The first 2 weeks of summer (Jun 12-25) may have limited camp availability as most summer camps start the week after public schools end.
- **Longer Christmas break**: 12 weekdays vs TDSB's 8. Extra days Dec 19 and Jan 5 won't have Christmas break programs running.

### Coverage Challenges (ranked by difficulty)
1. **Early summer weeks** (hardest) - Jun 12-25 are before most camps start their summer programs. Need to find providers with early-start options or arrange alternative coverage for ~9 weekdays.
2. **March break week 1** (hard) - Mar 9-13, public schools in session, no March break programs available. General day camp operators or family coverage needed.
3. **Midterm breaks** (medium) - Nov 7+10 and Feb 13+16 are isolated multi-day gaps. No dedicated programs. Family/WFH or drop-in care.
4. **Extra Christmas days** (easy) - Dec 19 and Jan 5 are single extra days on edges of the main break. Many Christmas break programs may extend to cover these.

### Annual Patterns
- KCS uses a "classes end / classes resume" format with breaks built around long weekends and multi-day midterm breaks rather than individual PA days
- March break is consistently 2 weeks (first week unique to KCS, second week aligns with Ontario public boards)
- School ends mid-June, ~2 weeks before public boards, creating a longer summer
- First day of school appears to be the Wednesday after Labour Day (Sep 3, 2025 = first Wed after Labour Day Sep 1)
