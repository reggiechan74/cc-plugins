## Planning Notes for GIST Families

### Annual Patterns
- GIST consistently has a **2-week March break** (vs. 1 week for Ontario public boards)
- GIST consistently has a **fall break** (~1 week in late Oct/early Nov) with no public board equivalent
- School start date **varies year to year** - sometimes aligns with post-Labour Day, sometimes starts before
- PA days **never align with TDSB** - plan for no dedicated PA day programs being available
- **Two early dismissal days** per year (before Christmas, last day) with no aftercare - need afternoon coverage

### Coverage Challenges (ranked by difficulty)
1. **Fall break** (hardest) - Full week, no equivalent public break, no provider market
2. **March break week 2** (hard) - Public schools back in session, March break programs ended
3. **PA days** (medium) - All misaligned, but single days are manageable with family/WFH
4. **Early dismissal days** (easy) - Only afternoon coverage needed, 2x per year
