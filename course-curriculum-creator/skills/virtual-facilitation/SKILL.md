# Virtual Facilitation for Workshop Design

## Overview

Virtual and hybrid workshops require fundamentally different design, not just putting a camera on an in-person session. Attention spans are shorter, engagement requires active design, technology introduces failure points, and facilitators must manage both content and technology simultaneously.

This skill provides practical guidance for designing workshops that work in virtual and hybrid formats, with specific timing constraints, engagement techniques, and technology considerations.

## Virtual vs. In-Person: Key Differences

| Dimension | In-Person | Virtual | Hybrid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Max session length** | 6 hours/day | 4 hours/day | 4 hours/day |
| **Break frequency** | Every 60 min | Every 45 min | Every 45 min |
| **Attention span per activity** | 20-30 min | 10-15 min | 10-15 min |
| **Engagement check-ins** | Every 30 min | Every 15-20 min | Every 15-20 min |
| **Group work format** | Table groups | Breakout rooms | Mixed (breakout + in-room) |
| **Materials format** | Print handouts | Digital documents, shared screens | Both digital + print |
| **Assessment method** | Written, observed, presented | Digital submission, screen share, chat | Both formats |
| **Buffer time** | 10% | 15% | 20% |
| **Setup time needed** | 15 min | 30 min (tech check) | 45 min (dual setup) |

## Virtual Workshop Design Principles

### 1. Chunk Everything Smaller

In-person modules of 90-120 minutes must be broken into 45-60 minute virtual segments:

**In-person module (90 min):**
- Instruction (25 min) -> Practice (40 min) -> Debrief (15 min) -> Break (10 min)

**Virtual equivalent (2 x 45 min):**
- Segment A: Instruction (15 min) -> Quick practice (15 min) -> Check-in (5 min) -> Break (10 min)
- Segment B: Deeper practice (20 min) -> Share-out (10 min) -> Debrief (10 min) -> Break (5 min)

### 2. Front-Load Engagement

The first 5 minutes of every virtual segment must include active participation:
- Poll or survey question
- Chat waterfall ("Type one word that describes...")
- Reaction/emoji check-in
- Quick breakout room introduction

Never start with a monologue. Never start with slides.

### 3. Vary Interaction Every 10-15 Minutes

Rotate through these engagement modes:
- **Listen** (instructor presents): Max 10 minutes uninterrupted
- **Write** (individual reflection in chat or document): 2-5 minutes
- **Discuss** (breakout rooms or whole-group): 5-15 minutes
- **Do** (hands-on exercise with screen share or digital tool): 10-20 minutes
- **React** (polls, reactions, thumbs up/down): 1-2 minutes

### 4. Make Cameras Optional but Engagement Mandatory

- Don't require cameras (bandwidth, home environment, fatigue)
- DO require active participation: chat responses, polls, breakout contributions
- Use the chat as a participation equalizer (introverts often prefer it)
- Set norms at the start: "Cameras optional, participation required"

### 5. Plan for Technology Failure

Every activity must have a tech-failure backup:
- Breakout rooms fail -> Large group discussion with hand-raising
- Screen share fails -> Describe verbally + send link in chat
- Digital whiteboard fails -> Individual reflection in chat
- Internet drops for participant -> Recording available, async catch-up instructions

## Virtual Activity Substitutions

| In-Person Activity | Virtual Substitute | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Table group discussion | Breakout rooms (3-4 people, 5-10 min) | Assign roles: facilitator, note-taker, reporter |
| Gallery walk | Virtual gallery (shared doc, Jamboard, Miro) | Async viewing + synchronous debrief |
| Post-it brainstorm | Digital whiteboard or chat waterfall | Miro, Jamboard, or just chat with emoji reactions |
| Physical demonstration | Screen share with narration | Record for replay; provide written steps |
| Pair work | Breakout rooms (2 people) | Shorter than in-person (5-7 min vs. 10-15 min) |
| Raised hand poll | Zoom poll, chat emoji, or Mentimeter | Results visible to all |
| Whiteboard diagram | Annotate on shared screen or digital whiteboard | Save and share screenshots |
| Role play | Breakout rooms with scenario cards | Provide written scenario in chat before breakout |
| Physical movement | Stretch break, off-screen reflection | "Stand up, grab water, write one thought on paper" |
| Print handouts | Shared Google Doc, PDF download, LMS | Send links in chat; confirm receipt |

## Hybrid-Specific Considerations

### The Equity Challenge

Hybrid is the hardest format because you must serve two audiences simultaneously. The default failure mode is that remote participants become passive observers.

**Equity Rules:**
1. If remote can't do it, in-room doesn't do it (or provide equivalent)
2. Facilitator addresses camera regularly (not just the room)
3. Chat is monitored continuously (assign a co-facilitator for chat)
4. In-room microphones capture all speakers (not just the facilitator)
5. Digital materials are the primary format (print is supplementary)

### Hybrid Technology Requirements

- Room camera: wide-angle showing facilitator + board/screen
- Participant camera: individual webcams for in-room participants (if possible)
- Room microphone: omnidirectional, picking up all speakers
- Screen sharing: facilitator's screen visible to both audiences
- Chat monitoring: dedicated person or second screen

### Hybrid Facilitation Model

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Lead facilitator** | Content delivery, in-room interaction, addresses camera |
| **Virtual co-facilitator** | Chat monitoring, breakout room management, tech troubleshooting |
| **Room support** (optional) | In-room logistics, microphone passing, time management |

## Virtual Workshop Schedule Template

### 1-Day Virtual (2 sessions x 3.5 hours)

```
Morning Session (9:00 - 12:30)
  09:00 - 09:15  Tech check + welcome
  09:15 - 09:30  Icebreaker / context setting
  09:30 - 10:15  Module 1 (45 min)
  10:15 - 10:25  Break
  10:25 - 11:10  Module 2 (45 min)
  11:10 - 11:20  Break
  11:20 - 12:05  Module 3 (45 min)
  12:05 - 12:15  Morning wrap-up + preview afternoon
  12:15 - 12:30  Buffer

--- Extended Lunch Break: 12:30 - 13:30 (60 min) ---

Afternoon Session (13:30 - 16:30)
  13:30 - 13:40  Re-engagement activity
  13:40 - 14:25  Module 4 (45 min)
  14:25 - 14:35  Break
  14:35 - 15:20  Module 5 (45 min)
  15:20 - 15:30  Break
  15:30 - 16:00  Capstone / integration activity (30 min)
  16:00 - 16:15  Wrap-up + action planning
  16:15 - 16:30  Buffer + Q&A
```

Total instruction time: ~5 hours (vs. 6 hours in-person)
Total elapsed time: 7.5 hours (vs. 7 hours in-person)
Break time: ~1.5 hours (vs. ~1 hour in-person)

### 2-Day Virtual (4 sessions x 3.5 hours)

Follow the same pattern across 4 half-day sessions over 2 days:
- Day 1 Morning: Modules 1-3
- Day 1 Afternoon: Modules 4-5
- Day 2 Morning: Modules 6-8
- Day 2 Afternoon: Modules 9-10 + Capstone

### Alternative: Multi-Day Virtual (4 x 2-hour sessions)

For audiences that can't do full-day virtual:
- Session 1 (Day 1): Modules 1-2
- Session 2 (Day 2): Modules 3-4
- Session 3 (Day 3): Modules 5-6
- Session 4 (Day 4): Review + Capstone

This spreads a 1-day workshop across 4 days, allowing practice between sessions.

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Zoom
- Use breakout room pre-assignment for repeated groups
- Polling is built-in (prepare polls in advance)
- Annotation tools work on shared screens
- Record to cloud for async review

### Microsoft Teams
- Breakout rooms require Teams Premium or manual channel creation
- Use Forms for polls (share link in chat)
- Whiteboard app integrates for collaborative diagramming
- Record to Stream/SharePoint

### Google Meet
- Breakout rooms available in Google Workspace
- Use Jamboard for collaborative whiteboarding
- Polls via embedded Google Forms
- Record to Google Drive

## Common Virtual Facilitation Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Lecturing for 20+ minutes | Participants multitask, disengage | Cap instruction at 10 min, then interact |
| Requiring cameras always on | Creates fatigue, inequity | Make participation mandatory, cameras optional |
| Not using chat | Misses participation channel | Ask chat questions every 10-15 min |
| Single facilitator for hybrid | Remote participants ignored | Assign dedicated virtual co-facilitator |
| No tech backup plan | Single failure derails the session | Pre-plan alternatives for every tech-dependent activity |
| Same timing as in-person | Exhaustion, poor retention | Reduce to 4 hrs/day, more breaks |
| Skipping tech check | Wasted first 20 minutes troubleshooting | Require tech check day before or 30 min early |
| No async component | No time for deeper reflection | Add pre-work and between-session assignments |
