## Key Adaptation Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Split into 2 sessions with 90-min lunch | Reduces screen fatigue; allows catch-up |
| 45-min modules instead of 90-min | Maintains attention in virtual format |
| Miro for all group activities | Consistent tool reduces cognitive load |
| Google Docs for individual work | Allows facilitator to monitor progress in real-time |
| Chat waterfall for sharing | Equalizes participation; introverts contribute more easily |
| Breakout pairs for peer review | Shorter and more intimate than group breakouts |
| Pre-built templates for all activities | Eliminates setup time during modules; reduces tech confusion |
