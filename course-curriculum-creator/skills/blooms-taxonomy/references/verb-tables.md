## Verb Disambiguation Guide

### Verbs That Appear at Multiple Levels

Many verbs appear in multiple cognitive levels but mean different things based on context. Here's how to distinguish:

#### "Select"

- **Remember level**: "Select the correct definition from a list" (recognition)
- **Analyze level**: "Select relevant data points for analysis" (discrimination)
- **Evaluate level**: "Select the best solution using defined criteria" (judgment)

**Guideline**: Add context to clarify cognitive demand.

#### "Compare"

- **Understand level**: "Compare features of two solutions" (surface-level)
- **Analyze level**: "Compare underlying business models of two solutions" (structural)
- **Evaluate level**: "Compare solutions to determine which better meets requirements" (judgment)

**Guideline**: Specify what aspect to compare and whether judgment is required.

#### "Describe"

- **Remember level**: "Describe the features of X" (recall)
- **Understand level**: "Describe how X works" (explanation)
- **Analyze level**: "Describe the relationship between X and Y" (connection)
- **Evaluate level**: "Describe why X is preferable to Y" (justification)

**Guideline**: Specify whether recalling, explaining, analyzing, or judging.

#### "Identify"

- **Remember level**: "Identify PropTech categories from a list" (recognition)
- **Analyze level**: "Identify patterns in PropTech adoption data" (pattern recognition)

**Guideline**: Add context about whether recognizing pre-defined items or discovering new patterns.

### Choosing the Right Verb

**Step 1: Determine intended cognitive level**
What complexity of thinking should students demonstrate?

**Step 2: Select verb that matches that level**
Use verb tables above to find appropriate options.

**Step 3: Add specific context**
Clarify what students do with what content under which conditions.

**Step 4: Validate measurability**
Can you observe and assess whether students achieved this?

**Example progression:**

| Draft | Issue | Improved Version |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| "Know PropTech" | Not measurable | "Explain how PropTech impacts real estate operations" |
| "Understand analysis" | Vague | "Apply SWOT analysis to PropTech use cases" |
| "Create analysis" | Verb mismatch | "Analyze PropTech use cases using SWOT framework" |

## Verb Selection by Workshop Type

### Lab-Heavy Workshops (70% practice)

**Prioritize action-oriented verbs:**
- Apply, use, implement, execute, practice
- Analyze, examine, investigate
- Design, develop, create (for capstone)

**Minimize:**
- Remember, recall, list (pre-work instead)
- Explain, describe (embed in practice activities)

### Lecture-Heavy Workshops (70% instruction)

**Prioritize comprehension verbs:**
- Explain, compare, contrast, summarize
- Analyze, differentiate, examine
- Evaluate, critique, justify

**Use carefully:**
- Apply verbs (need time for practice)
- Create verbs (need synthesis time)

### Balanced Workshops (50/50)

**Mix across levels:**
- 1-2 Understand objectives
- 3-4 Apply objectives
- 1-2 Analyze objectives
- 0-1 Evaluate/Create objectives

## Common Verb Selection Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Verbs

❌ **Poor**: "Understand PropTech"
- "Understand" is not an action verb
- Cannot observe or measure

✅ **Better**: "Explain how PropTech solutions address real estate operational challenges"
- "Explain" is observable
- Context specifies what to explain

### Mistake 2: Verb-Level Mismatch

❌ **Poor**: "Create an evaluation of PropTech vendors"
- "Create" (Level 6) but task is evaluation (Level 5)

✅ **Better**: "Evaluate PropTech vendors using a multi-criteria rubric"
- "Evaluate" matches the cognitive demand

### Mistake 3: Ambiguous Context

❌ **Poor**: "Analyze PropTech"
- Analyze what aspect?
- Using what method?

✅ **Better**: "Analyze PropTech market trends using Porter's Five Forces to identify opportunities"
- Clear what to analyze
- Clear method
- Clear purpose

### Mistake 4: Multiple Cognitive Levels in One Objective

❌ **Poor**: "Identify, analyze, and recommend PropTech solutions"
- Three different cognitive levels (Remember, Analyze, Evaluate)
- Impossible to assess as single objective

✅ **Better**: Split into three objectives:
1. "Identify PropTech solutions addressing operational challenges" (Remember/Understand)
2. "Analyze PropTech solutions against organizational requirements" (Analyze)
3. "Recommend the best-fit PropTech solution with justification" (Evaluate)

## Quick Reference: Verb-to-Assessment Matching

Use this guide to ensure verb selection matches your assessment method:

| If assessment is... | Use verbs from... | Example objective |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Multiple choice quiz | Remember | "Identify key PropTech categories" |
| Written explanation | Understand | "Explain PropTech disruption mechanisms" |
| Framework application exercise | Apply | "Apply Porter's Five Forces to analyze use case" |
