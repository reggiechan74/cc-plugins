# Example Learning Objectives: 1-Day PropTech Workshop

**Course:** PropTech Fundamentals for Real Estate Professionals
**Duration:** 1 day (6 hours instruction)
**Audience:** Real estate operators with 5+ years experience, minimal PropTech exposure
**Format:** Lab-heavy (70% practice, 30% instruction)

## Complete Objective Set

### Objective 1 (Understand Level)
**Explain how PropTech solutions disrupt traditional real estate value chains**

- **Cognitive Level:** Understand
- **Time Allocation:** 45 minutes (Module 1, Morning)
- **Assessment:** Written explanation comparing traditional vs. PropTech-enabled processes
- **Action Verb:** Explain
- **Rationale:** Foundation understanding before application

### Objective 2 (Apply Level)
**Apply Porter's Five Forces framework to analyze PropTech use cases in commercial real estate**

- **Cognitive Level:** Apply
- **Time Allocation:** 90 minutes (Module 2, Morning)
- **Assessment:** Framework application exercise with provided use cases
- **Action Verb:** Apply
- **Rationale:** Core skill—using analytical frameworks

### Objective 3 (Apply Level)
**Use a standardized evaluation rubric to assess PropTech vendor solutions**

- **Cognitive Level:** Apply
- **Time Allocation:** 90 minutes (Module 3, Afternoon)
- **Assessment:** Evaluate 2 vendor proposals using rubric template
- **Action Verb:** Use
- **Rationale:** Practical skill for vendor selection

### Objective 4 (Apply Level)
**Implement value chain analysis to identify PropTech opportunities in real estate operations**

- **Cognitive Level:** Apply
- **Time Allocation:** 75 minutes (Module 4, Afternoon)
- **Assessment:** Value chain mapping exercise for participant's organization
- **Action Verb:** Implement
- **Rationale:** Personalized application to own context

### Objective 5 (Analyze Level - Stretch)
**Analyze PropTech adoption barriers specific to organizational context**

- **Cognitive Level:** Analyze
- **Time Allocation:** 60 minutes (Module 5, Afternoon - Optional)
- **Assessment:** Root cause analysis of adoption challenges
- **Action Verb:** Analyze
- **Rationale:** Bridge to implementation planning (if time allows)

## Progression Notes

**Morning (3 hours):**
- Start with Understand (Objective 1) to build conceptual foundation
- Progress to Apply (Objective 2) with guided framework usage
- 40% instruction, 60% practice

**Afternoon (3 hours):**
- Continue Apply level (Objectives 3-4) with more independence
- Introduce Analyze (Objective 5) if group pace allows
- 20% instruction, 80% practice

**Scaffolding:**
- Each Apply objective builds on previous
- Objective 2 introduces frameworks → Objective 3 applies to vendors → Objective 4 applies to own organization
- Objective 5 synthesizes learning from all prior objectives

## Time Budget

| Module | Objective | Level | Time |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|
| 1 | Explain disruption | Understand | 45 min |
| 2 | Apply Porter's Five Forces | Apply | 90 min |
| Break | - | - | 15 min |
| 3 | Use evaluation rubric | Apply | 90 min |
| Lunch | - | - | 60 min |
| 4 | Implement value chain | Apply | 75 min |
| 5 | Analyze barriers (optional) | Analyze | 60 min |
| **Total** | | | **375 min (6.25 hrs instruction)** |

**Buffer:** 15 minutes for overruns, Q&A, transitions

## Assessment Alignment

| Objective | Cognitive Level | Assessment Type | Success Criteria |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Understand | Written explanation | Accurately explains 3+ disruption mechanisms with examples |
| 2 | Apply | Framework application | Correctly identifies all 5 forces with supporting evidence |
| 3 | Apply | Rubric-based evaluation | Consistently applies rubric criteria, scores aligned with evidence |
| 4 | Apply | Value chain mapping | Identifies 4+ opportunities aligned with value chain analysis |
| 5 | Analyze | Root cause analysis | Distinguishes surface symptoms from underlying barriers, proposes 2+ strategies |

## Objective Characteristics

- **Total Objectives:** 5 (4 core + 1 optional)
- **SMART:** All objectives specify observable action, clear context, and assessment criteria
- **Achievable:** Time-tested in prior workshops, realistic for 1-day format
- **Measurable:** Each has clear success criteria and assessment method
- **Relevant:** Directly applicable to participants' work contexts
- **Progression:** Scaffolds from Understand → Apply → Analyze

## Notes for Customization

**If audience is more advanced:**
- Reduce time on Objective 1 (or assign as pre-work)
- Add Evaluate objective: "Recommend best-fit PropTech solution with justification"

**If audience needs more foundation:**
- Add Remember objective (pre-work): "Identify PropTech categories and common use cases"
- Extend Objective 1 time to 60 minutes

**If time is shorter (4-5 hours):**
- Remove Objective 5 (Analyze level)
- Focus on Objectives 1-4 (Understand + 3 Apply)
