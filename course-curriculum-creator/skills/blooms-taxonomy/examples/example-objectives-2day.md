## Cognitive Level Progression

**Day 1 Morning:** Understand → Apply → Apply
**Day 1 Afternoon:** Analyze
**Day 2 Morning:** Analyze → Evaluate
**Day 2 Afternoon:** Evaluate → Create

**Scaffolding Logic:**
- Understand business models (Obj 1) enables market analysis (Obj 2)
- Stakeholder analysis (Obj 3) informs vendor analysis (Obj 4)
- Vendor analysis (Obj 4) feeds readiness assessment (Obj 5)
- Readiness (Obj 5) guides solution evaluation (Obj 6)
- Evaluation (Obj 6) precedes implementation critique (Obj 7)
- All prior objectives support capstone design (Obj 8)

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

```
Objective 1 (Understand) → Required for → Objective 2 (Apply)
Objective 2 (Apply) → Required for → Objective 4 (Analyze)
Objective 3 (Apply) → Required for → Objective 5 (Analyze)
Objectives 4 + 5 (Analyze) → Required for → Objective 6 (Evaluate)
Objective 6 (Evaluate) → Required for → Objective 7 (Evaluate)
Objectives 1-7 → Required for → Objective 8 (Create)
```

**Cannot skip levels:** Each objective depends on mastery of prerequisites at lower cognitive levels.

## Notes for Customization

**If audience is less experienced:**
- Add Remember objective (pre-work): "Define PropTech categories and core technologies"
- Extend Day 1 Understand objective to 90 minutes
- Reduce Create objective complexity (60-day roadmap instead of 90-day)

**If audience is highly experienced:**
- Compress Objectives 1-3 into pre-work or rapid review (90 minutes total)
- Add second Create objective: "Develop business case for PropTech investment"
- Increase sophistication of Evaluate objectives (weighted scoring with sensitivity analysis)

**If format is lab-heavy instead of balanced:**
- Reduce instruction time per module by 25%
- Add more independent practice opportunities
- Increase peer review and group work components

**Day 1 to Day 2 connection:**
- Day 1 ends with Analyze (Objective 4) to set up overnight reflection
- Day 2 begins with related Analyze (Objective 5) to bridge from previous day
- Day 2 progression (Analyze → Evaluate → Create) builds to capstone synthesis
