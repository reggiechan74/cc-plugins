# Example UDL Application: 1-Day Data Analysis Workshop

**Course:** Introduction to Data Analysis for Business Professionals
**Duration:** 1 day (6 hours instruction, 9:00-4:00)
**Audience:** Mid-career professionals transitioning into data-informed roles; mixed technical backgrounds
**Format:** In-person with hybrid option; 20-30 participants

## Module Schedule with UDL Annotations

### Module 1 - Why Data Matters (9:00-9:45)

**Objective:** Explain how data analysis improves decision-making in business contexts.

| UDL Principle | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Representation** | Verbal walkthrough of 2 case studies + printed one-page summary + projected visuals with annotated charts |
| **Engagement** | Participants choose which case study to discuss first; opening poll ("What frustrates you about data?") to surface personal relevance |
| **Expression** | Respond via sticky notes on wall, typed chat message, or verbal share-out -- any format accepted |

### Module 2 - Spreadsheet Fundamentals (9:45-11:15)

**Objective:** Use core spreadsheet functions (SORT, FILTER, SUMIF) to organize a raw dataset.

| UDL Principle | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Representation** | Live demo projected + pre-recorded 3-min screencasts for each function + step-by-step written guide with screenshots |
| **Engagement** | Three dataset options (retail sales, employee survey, website traffic) -- learners pick the one closest to their work |
| **Expression** | Submit completed spreadsheet OR annotated screenshot of key formulas OR walk instructor through solution verbally |

*11:15-11:30 -- Break*

### Module 3 - Building Your First Visualization (11:30-1:00)

**Objective:** Create a chart that accurately communicates a trend or comparison from a dataset.

| UDL Principle | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Representation** | Gallery of 6 chart types on printed handout + projected "when to use which chart" decision tree + verbal narration |
| **Engagement** | Learners set a personal goal: "I want to visualize _____ from my dataset." Instructor circulates to connect goal to chart type |
| **Expression** | Produce chart in spreadsheet tool of choice (Excel, Sheets, or even hand-drawn sketch on template). Assessed on accuracy, not tool proficiency |

*1:00-2:00 -- Lunch*

### Module 4 - Interpreting Results and Spotting Pitfalls (2:00-3:15)

**Objective:** Identify at least two common misinterpretations in a provided data summary and explain why they are misleading.

| UDL Principle | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Representation** | Flawed report handed out in print + same content projected + instructor reads key paragraphs aloud, pausing at each error |
| **Engagement** | "Myth-busting" frame: learners compete in pairs to find the most errors. Optional: work solo if preferred |
| **Expression** | Submit corrections as written annotations on the handout, a bulleted list in a shared doc, or verbal explanation to a partner who records it |

*3:15-3:30 -- Break*

### Module 5 - Communicating Findings to Stakeholders (3:30-4:00)

**Objective:** Present a data insight using a structure appropriate for a non-technical audience.

| UDL Principle | Implementation |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Representation** | One strong example presentation shown as video (2 min) + same content as a one-page written memo + verbal debrief of what made it effective |
| **Engagement** | Learners choose their own insight from earlier modules; presentation framed as "something you can reuse Monday morning" |
| **Expression** | Deliver as a 60-second verbal pitch, a written memo, or a single annotated slide -- learner chooses format |

## Before/After Comparison: Module 2

### Without UDL

> **Spreadsheet Fundamentals (90 min)**
> Instructor demonstrates SORT, FILTER, and SUMIF on a retail sales dataset projected on screen. Participants follow along on their laptops using the same dataset. At the end, participants complete a worksheet requiring all three functions applied to new columns in the same retail file. Submissions are graded on correct formula syntax.

**Problems identified:**
- Single dataset removes relevance for non-retail participants
- Only visual+verbal instruction mode -- no written reference to return to
- One rigid output format penalizes slow typists and non-native-English speakers
- "Follow along" pace locked to the instructor's speed (too fast for some, too slow for others)
- No way to review a missed step without interrupting the class

### With UDL

> **Spreadsheet Fundamentals (90 min)**
> Instructor demonstrates functions via live demo (projected + narrated). Pre-recorded 3-min screencasts available for replay at own pace. Written step-by-step guide with screenshots provided. Participants choose from three datasets (retail, HR, web traffic). Submission accepted as completed spreadsheet, annotated screenshot, or verbal walkthrough with instructor.

**What changed and why:**
- **+2 representation modes** (screencast, written guide) -- supports re-processing and different learning speeds
- **+2 dataset options** -- increases relevance and autonomy, a core UDL engagement lever
- **+2 expression formats** -- separates "can you use the function" from "can you type fast in English"
- **Self-paced screencasts** -- removes the artificial constraint of lockstep pacing
- **No change to the learning objective** -- the goal is identical; only the pathways to get there are multiplied

## Built-in Accommodations Summary

These accommodations are designed into the workshop from the start -- they are not retrofit add-ons:

| Category | Accommodation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Breaks** | 15-min break every 90 min; lunch at midday; participants may step out quietly at any time |
| **Materials** | All slides, handouts, and datasets distributed digitally (accessible PDF + original files) before the session starts |
| **Fonts and visuals** | Minimum 24pt on projected slides; sans-serif fonts; high-contrast color palette; no color-only encoding on charts |
| **Pacing** | Pre-recorded screencasts allow self-pacing; no timed quizzes |
| **Physical space** | Seating options include standard desks, standing tables, and a couch area for laptop work |
| **Language** | Key terms defined on a printed glossary sheet; jargon flagged explicitly during instruction |
| **Digital access** | All tools used are browser-based with no software install required; screen-reader-compatible templates provided |

## UDL Scorecard

| UDL Principle | Rating | Evidence |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| **Representation** (multiple formats) | STRONG | Every module uses 3+ formats (verbal, visual, written). Screencasts add asynchronous replay. |
| **Engagement** (choice and relevance) | STRONG | Dataset choice in Module 2, personal goal-setting in Module 3, real-work framing in Module 5. |
| **Expression** (flexible demonstration) | STRONG | All 5 modules accept 2-3 output formats. No module locks learners into a single mode. |
| **Self-regulation support** | ADEQUATE | Personal goal-setting in Module 3 and "reuse Monday" framing help, but no explicit reflection or self-assessment checkpoint is built in. |
| **Executive function support** | ADEQUATE | Printed schedule and glossary help. Could improve with a progress-tracking checklist or visual agenda board updated between modules. |

### Improvement opportunities

- Add a 5-min reflection journal prompt between Modules 4 and 5 to strengthen self-regulation.
- Provide a one-page "workshop roadmap" handout showing module flow, objectives, and checkboxes so learners can track their own progress.
- Consider adding a brief mid-morning check-in where participants rate their confidence on a 1-3 scale to help the instructor adjust pacing.

## Key UDL Design Decisions

1. **Three datasets instead of one in Module 2** -- the single biggest UDL lever in this workshop. Minimal prep cost (same structure, different content), large relevance payoff.
2. **Expression options on every module** -- prevents any single module from becoming a bottleneck for learners who struggle with one output mode.
3. **Screencasts as a parallel channel, not a replacement** -- live demo builds social presence; screencasts handle the "I missed that step" problem without requiring the learner to ask.
4. **Accommodations designed in, not bolted on** -- the break schedule, font sizes, and material formats are part of the initial design, not an accessibility addendum.
5. **Myth-busting frame in Module 4** -- reframes error-finding as a game rather than a test, reducing anxiety for participants who fear "getting it wrong."
