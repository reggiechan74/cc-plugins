# Example Backward Design: 1-Day PropTech Workshop

**Course:** PropTech Fundamentals for Real Estate Professionals
**Duration:** 1 day (6 hours instruction)
**Audience:** Real estate operators with 5+ years experience, minimal PropTech exposure

## Stage 1: Desired Results

### Learning Outcomes (5 objectives)

| # | Outcome | Bloom's Level |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Explain how PropTech disrupts traditional real estate value chains | Understand |
| 2 | Apply Porter's Five Forces framework to PropTech use cases | Apply |
| 3 | Use a standardized rubric to assess PropTech vendor solutions | Apply |
| 4 | Implement value chain analysis for PropTech opportunities | Apply |
| 5 | Analyze PropTech adoption barriers in organizational context (stretch) | Analyze |

### Enduring Understandings
- PropTech creates value by restructuring real estate processes, not just digitizing them
- Analytical frameworks reduce bias in technology adoption decisions
- Adoption barriers are organizational, not just technical

### Worth Being Familiar With (not tested)
- PropTech market size and growth trends
- Specific vendor names and product features
- Regulatory landscape details

## Stage 2: Acceptable Evidence

### Assessment Plan

| Outcome | Assessment Method | Timing | Success Criteria |
|---------|-------------------|--------|------------------|
| 1 (Understand) | Written comparison of traditional vs. PropTech processes | Module 1, 45 min | Accurately explains 3+ disruption mechanisms with examples |
| 2 (Apply) | Porter's Five Forces analysis on provided use case | Module 2, 90 min | Correctly identifies all 5 forces with supporting evidence |
| 3 (Apply) | Vendor evaluation using rubric template | Module 3, 90 min | Consistently applies criteria; scores align with evidence |
| 4 (Apply) | Value chain map for participant's own organization | Module 4, 75 min | Identifies 4+ opportunities aligned with analysis |
| 5 (Analyze) | Root cause analysis of adoption challenges | Module 5, 60 min | Distinguishes symptoms from barriers; proposes 2+ strategies |

### Formative Checks (embedded)
- **Module 1:** Think-pair-share after disruption examples (5 min)
- **Module 2:** Instructor check-in at 30-min mark during framework exercise
- **Module 3:** Peer comparison of rubric scores before group debrief
- **Module 4:** Quick poll on confidence applying value chain analysis

### Alignment Validation
- All 5 outcomes have corresponding performance assessments
- Assessment methods match cognitive levels (explanations for Understand, exercises for Apply, analysis for Analyze)
- No orphaned assessments or untested outcomes

## Stage 3: Learning Experiences

### Activity Design (derived from Stage 2 assessments)

**Module 1 - PropTech Disruption (45 min)**
Outcome 1 assessment requires explaining disruption mechanisms, so activities must build understanding of value chain transformation:
- Mini-lecture: 3 disruption case studies (15 min)
- Think-pair-share: "Which disruption pattern applies to your market?" (10 min)
- Written explanation exercise (assessment) (15 min)
- Debrief and transition (5 min)

**Module 2 - Strategic Analysis Frameworks (90 min)**
Outcome 2 assessment requires applying Porter's Five Forces, so activities must teach the framework and provide guided practice:
- Framework introduction with worked example (20 min)
- Guided practice: Apply to familiar industry first (25 min)
- Independent practice: Apply to PropTech use case (assessment) (35 min)
- Debrief: Compare analyses across groups (10 min)

**Module 3 - Vendor Evaluation (90 min)**
Outcome 3 assessment requires using an evaluation rubric, so activities must introduce the rubric and scaffold its application:
- Rubric walkthrough with scoring example (15 min)
- Guided scoring: Evaluate sample vendor together (25 min)
- Independent evaluation: Score 2 vendor proposals (assessment) (35 min)
- Peer comparison and calibration (15 min)

**Module 4 - Value Chain Mapping (75 min)**
Outcome 4 assessment requires mapping own organization, so activities must teach the method and enable personalized application:
- Value chain analysis method overview (10 min)
- Group exercise: Map a sample organization (20 min)
- Individual exercise: Map own organization (assessment) (35 min)
- Share findings with table group (10 min)

**Module 5 - Adoption Barriers (60 min, optional)**
Outcome 5 assessment requires root cause analysis, so activities must introduce barrier categories and analytical methods:
- Barrier categories overview with examples (10 min)
- Group brainstorm: Barriers in participants' contexts (15 min)
- Root cause analysis exercise (assessment) (25 min)
- Strategies discussion and wrap-up (10 min)

### Schedule with Breaks

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 9:00-9:45 | Module 1: PropTech Disruption | Understand level |
| 9:45-11:15 | Module 2: Strategic Analysis | Apply level |
| 11:15-11:30 | Break | |
| 11:30-1:00 | Module 3: Vendor Evaluation | Apply level |
| 1:00-2:00 | Lunch | |
| 2:00-3:15 | Module 4: Value Chain Mapping | Apply level |
| 3:15-3:30 | Break | |
| 3:30-4:30 | Module 5: Adoption Barriers | Analyze level (stretch) |
| 4:30-4:45 | Wrap-up and next steps | |

### Alignment Verification

Every activity was derived from Stage 2 assessments, which were derived from Stage 1 outcomes:
- No tangential content (no "nice to know" lectures without outcome connection)
- Practice activities mirror assessment format (students practice what they'll be tested on)
- Scaffolding: Understand -> Apply -> Apply -> Apply -> Analyze
- 70/30 practice-to-instruction ratio maintained

## Key Backward Design Decisions

1. **Excluded "PropTech market overview" lecture** - interesting but doesn't support any assessment; moved to optional pre-reading
2. **Porter's Five Forces before vendor evaluation** - Outcome 2 builds analytical skills needed for Outcome 3
3. **Own-organization mapping in Module 4** - Authentic context makes assessment immediately applicable
4. **Module 5 is optional** - Analyze level requires more time; only include if group pace allows
5. **Formative checks embedded** - Enable instructor to adjust pacing without separate assessment blocks
